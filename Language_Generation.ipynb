on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but often dreamed of .\\n\\nit was the yuletide , that men call christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon , older than memphis and mankind . it was the yuletide , and i had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden ; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century , that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten . mine were an old people , and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before . and they were strange , because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids , and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the blue-eyed fishers . and now they were scattered , and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand . i was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade , for only the poor and the lonely remember .\\n\\nthen beyond the hill\\'s crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming ; snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples , ridgepoles and chimney-pots , wharves and small bridges , willow-trees and graveyards ; endless labyrinths of steep , narrow , crooked streets , and dizzy church-crowned central peak that time durst not touch ; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child\\'s disordered blocks ; antiquity hovering on grey wings over winter-whitened gables and gambrel roofs ; fanlights and small-paned windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join orion and the archaic stars . and against the rotting wharves the sea pounded ; the secretive , immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time .\\n\\nbeside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose , bleak and windswept , and i saw that it was a burying-ground where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse . the printless road was very lonely , and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind . they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in 1692 , but i did not know just where .\\n\\nas the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry sounds of a village at evening , but did not hear them . then i thought of the season , and felt that these old puritan folk might well have christmas customs strange to me , and full of silent hearthside prayer . so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers , kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze , and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little , curtained windows .\\n\\ni had seen maps of the town , and knew where to find the home of my people . it was told that i should be known and welcomed , for village legend lives long ; so i hastened through back street to circle court , and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town , to where green lane leads off behind the market house . the old maps still held good , and i had no trouble ; though at arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place , since i saw not a wire overhead . snow would have hid the rails in any case . i was glad i had chosen to walk , for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill ; and now i was eager to knock at the door of my people , the seventh house on the left in green lane , with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second storey , all built before 1650 .\\n\\nthere were lights inside the house when i came upon it , and i saw from the diamond window-panes that it must have been kept very close to its antique state . the upper part overhung the narrow grass-grown street and nearly met the over-hanging part of the house opposite , so that i was almost in a tunnel , with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow . there was no sidewalk , but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings . it was an odd scene , and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before . though it pleased me , i would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow , and people in the streets , and a few windows without drawn curtains .\\n\\nwhen i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid . some fear had been gathering in me , perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage , and the bleakness of the evening , and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs . and when my knock was answered i was fully afraid , because i had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open . but i was not afraid long , for the gowned , slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me ; and though he made signs that he was dumb , he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried .\\n\\nhe beckoned me into a low , candle-lit room with massive exposed rafters and dark , stiff , sparse furniture of the seventeenth century . the past was vivid there , for not an attribute was missing . there was a cavernous fireplace and a spinning-wheel at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep poke-bonnet sat back toward me , silently spinning despite the festive season . an indefinite dampness seemed upon the place , and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing . the high-backed settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left , and seemed to be occupied , though i was not sure . i did not like everything about what i saw , and felt again the fear i had had . this fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it , for the more i looked at the old man\\'s bland face the more its very blandness terrified me . the eyes never moved , and the skin was too much like wax . finally i was sure it was not a face at all , but a fiendishly cunning mask . but the flabby hands , curiously gloved , wrote genially on the tablet and told me i must wait a while before i could be led to the place of the festival .\\n\\npointing to a chair , table , and pile of books , the old man now left the room ; and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and mouldy , and that they included old morryster\\'s wild marvels of science , the terrible saducismus triumphatus of joseph glanvil , published in 1681 , the shocking daemonolatreja of remigius , printed in 1595 at lyons , and worst of all , the unmentionable necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , in olaus wormius\\' forbidden latin translation ; a book which i had never seen , but of which i had heard monstrous things whispered . no one spoke to me , but i could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside , and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning , spinning . i thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting , but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings , i resolved to expect queer things . so i tried to read , and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursed necronomicon ; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness , but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced , as if it had been stealthily opened . it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman\\'s spinning-wheel . this was not much , though , for the old woman was spinning very hard , and the aged clock had been striking . after that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle , and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume , and sat down on that very bench , so that i could not see him . it was certainly nervous waiting , and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so . when eleven struck , however , the old man stood up , glided to a massive carved chest in a corner , and got two hooded cloaks ; one of which he donned , and the other of which he draped round the old woman , who was ceasing her monotonous spinning . then they both started for the outer door ; the woman lamely creeping , and the old man , after picking up the very book i had been reading , beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask .\\n\\nwe went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient town ; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one , and the dog star leered at the throng of cowled , cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that , past the creaking sigus and antediluvian gables , the thatched roofs and diamond-paned windows ; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together ; gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations .\\n\\namid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides ; jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft , and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy ; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word . up , up , up , the eery columns slithered , and i saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town , where perched a great white church . i had seen it from the road\\'s crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk , and it had made me shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire .\\n\\nthere was an open space around the church ; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts , and partly a half-paved square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind , and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables . death-fires danced over the tombs , revealing gruesome vistas , though queerly failing to cast any shadows . past the churchyard , where there were no houses , i could see over the hill\\'s summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour , though the town was invisible in the dark . only once in a while a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church . i waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway , and till all the stragglers had followed . the old man was pulling at my sleeve , but i was determined to be the last . crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown darkness , i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement . and as i did so i shuddered . for though the wind had not left much snow , a few patches did remain on the path near the door ; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet , not even mine .\\n\\nthe church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it , for most of the throng had already vanished . they had streamed up the aisle between the high pews to the trap-door of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit , and were now squirming noiselessly in . i followed dumbly down the foot-worn steps and into the dark , suffocating crypt . the tail of that sinuous line of night-marchers seemed very horrible , and as i saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still . then i noticed that the tomb\\'s floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding , and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of rough-hewn stone ; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous , that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar . it was a silent , shocking descent , and i observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature , as if chiselled out of the solid rock . what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes . after more aeons of descent i saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery . soon they became excessively numerous , like impious catacombs of nameless menace ; and their pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable . i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself , and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil .\\n\\nthen i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light , and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters . again i shivered , for i did not like the things that the night had brought , and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite . as the steps and the passage grew broader , i heard another sound , the thin , whining mockery of a feeble flute ; and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner world--a vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean .\\n\\nfainting and gasping , i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan toadstools , leprous fire and slimy water , and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar . it was the yule-rite , older than man and fated to survive him ; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring\\'s promise beyond the snows ; the rite of fire and evergreen , light and music . and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the rite , and adore the sick pillar of flame , and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare . i saw this , and i saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light , piping noisomely on a flute ; and as the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where i could not see . but what frightened me most was that flaming column ; spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable , casting no shadows as healthy flame should , and coating the nitrous stone with a nasty , venomous verdigris . for in all that seething combustion no warmth lay , but only the clamminess of death and corruption .\\n\\nthe man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame , and made stiff ceremonial motions to the semi-circle he faced . at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance , especially when he held above his head that abhorrent necronomicon he had taken with him ; and i shared all the obeisances because i had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers . then the old man made a signal to the half-seen flute-player in the darkness , which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key ; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected . at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth , transfixed with a dread not of this or any world , but only of the mad spaces between the stars .\\n\\nout of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame , out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny , unheard , and unsuspected , there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame , trained , hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp , or sound brain ever wholly remember . they were not altogether crows , nor moles , nor buzzards , nor ants , nor vampire bats , nor decomposed human beings ; but something i cannot and must not recall . they flopped limply along , half with their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings ; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them , and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river , into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts .\\n\\nthe old spinning woman had gone with the throng , and the old man remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest . i saw when i staggered to my feet that the amorphous flute-player had rolled out of sight , but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by . as i hung back , the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place ; that it had been decreed i should come back , and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed . he wrote this in a very ancient hand , and when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch , both with my family arms , to prove that he was what he said . but it was a hideous proof , because i knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my great-great-great-great-grandfather in 1698 .\\n\\npresently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face , but i only shuddered , because i was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask . the flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the lichens , and i saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself . when one of the things began to waddle and edge away , he turned quickly to stop it ; so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head . and then , because that nightmare\\'s position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come , i flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea ; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earth\\'s inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these pest-gulfs might conceal .\\n\\nat the hospital they told me i had been found half-frozen in kingsport harbour at dawn , clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me . they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before , and fallen over the cliffs at orange point ; a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow . there was nothing i could say , because everything was wrong . everything was wrong , with the broad windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient , and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below . they insisted that this was kingsport , and i could not deny it . when i went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on central hill , they sent me to st . mary\\'s hospital in arkham , where i could have better care . i liked it there , for the doctors were broad-minded , and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazred\\'s objectionable necronomicon from the library of miskatonic university . they said something about a \"psychosis\" and agreed i had better get any harassing obsessions off my mind .\\n\\nso i read that hideous chapter , and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me . i had seen it before , let footprints tell what they might ; and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten . there was no one--in waking hours--who could remind me of it ; but my dreams are filled with terror , because of phrases i dare not quote . i dare quote only one paragraph , put into such english as i can make from the awkward low latin .\\n\\n\"the nethermost caverns ,\" wrote the mad arab , \"are not for the fathoming of eyes that see ; for their marvels are strange and terrific . cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied , and evil the mind that is held by no head . wisely did ibn schacabao say , that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain , and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes . for it is of old rumour that the soul of the devil-bought hastes not from his charnel clay , but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws ; till out of corruption horrid life springs , and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it . great holes secretly are digged where earth\\'s pores ought to suffice , and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl .\"\\n', shape=(), dtype=string)\n"
